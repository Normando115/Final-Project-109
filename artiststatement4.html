<h1> Artist Statement</h1>
<p> My goal in the future is to get a job in a small art studio that
	focuses on animations or art in general depending on where my art
	brings me. My short term goal is to get an internship anywhere and after the
	internship ends, I hope for it to turn into a full time job. After a few years,
	I wish to travel somewhere and pursue an art career there as I don't want to live in San Francisco in the future. </p>
