<h1> Artist Statement</h1>
<p> This room represents my past as a buser. It was my first ever job and it is
	something that I consider a significant part of my life. It was my starting point
	and although I enjoyed it a lot, I knew that it was not something I
wanted to do for a large portion of my life. Although its not what I will strive for,
it is a place I appreciate.  </p>
