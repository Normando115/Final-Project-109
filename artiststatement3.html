<h4> Artist Statement</h4>
<h5> After I graduate, my life will be centered around my room for some time.
	 The reason being is I feel like my art is not good enough or I am not satisfied
	 with my current art which has led me to want to spend time improving it without distractions.
In the timeframe of 2-4 months, I will be doing individual studies on traditional art and digital art,
while also taking profressional classes every once in a while to experience more of the art world. </h5>
